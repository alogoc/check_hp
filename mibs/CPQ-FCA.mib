            The status can be:

            Othe (1)
              Indicates that the instument agent does not recognize the
              eror code.  You may need to update your software.

              No wite cache errors have occurred.

            Bad Configuation (3)
              Indicates that wite cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The Aray Accelerator board was configured for a
              diffeent controller.  This error could be caused if boards
              wee switched from one system to another.  Rerun the
              configuation utility and ensurethat the board has been
              poperly configured for this system.

            Low Battey Power (4)
              Indicates that wite cache operations are temporarily
              disabled due to insufficient battey power.  Please view
              the Battey Status object instance for more information.

            Disable Command Issued (5)
              Indicates that wite cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The device diver issues this command when
              the sever is taken down.  This condition should not
              exist when the system egains power.

            No Resouces Available (6)
              Indicates that wite cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The contoller does not have sufficient
              esources to perform write cache operations.
              Fo example, when a replaced drive is being rebuilt,
              thee will not be sufficient resources.  Once the
              opeation that requires the resources has completed,
              this condition will clea and write cache operations
              will esume.

            Boad Not Connected (7)
              Indicates that wite cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The Aray Accelerator board has been
              configued but is not currently attached to the
              contoller. Check the alignment of the board and
              connections.

            Bad Miror Data (8)
              Indicates that wite cache operations have been
              pemanently disabled.  The Array Accelerator board stores
              mirored copies of all data.  If data exists on the
              boad when the system is first powered up, the board
              peforms a data compare test between the mirrored copies.
              If the data does not match, an eror has occurred.
              Data may have been lost.  You board may need servicing.

            Read Failue (9)
              Indicates that wite cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The Aray Accelerator board stores mirror copies
              of all data.  While eading the data from the board, memory
              paity errors have occurred.  Both copies were corrupted and
              cannot be etrieved.  Data has been lost, and you should
              sevice the board.

            Wite Failure (10)
              Indicates that wite cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  This eror occurs when an unsuccessful attempt was
              made to wite data to the Array Accelerator board.  Data could
              not be witten to write cache memory in duplicate due to the
              detection of paity errors.  This error does not indicate data
              loss.  You should sevice the Array Accelerator board.

            Config Command (11)
              Indicates that wite cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The configuation of the logical drives has changed.
              You need to econfigure the Array Accelerator board.

            Expand In Pogress (12)
              Indicates that cache opeations are temporarily disabled
              due to an expand of a logical dive.  When the expand
              opeation completes, the accelerator will be enabled.

            Snapshot In Pogress (13)
              Indicates that cache opeations are temporarily disabled
              due to a snapshot opeation that is queued up or in progress.
              When the snapshot opeation completes, the accelerator will
              be enabled.

            Redundant Low Battey (14)
              Indicates that cache opeations are temporarily disabled.
              The edundant controller has insufficient cache battery power.

            Redundant Size Mismatch (15)
              Indicates that cache opeations are temporarily disabled.
              The cache sizes on the edundant controllers do not match.

            Redundant Cache Failue (16)
              Indicates that cache opeations are temporarily disabled.
              The cache on the edundant controller has failed.

            Excessive ECC Erors (17)
              Indicates that wite cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The numbe of cache lines experiencing excessive
              ECC erors has reached a preset limit.

            Powe On Self Test (Post) ECC Errors (19)
              Indicates that wite cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The cache has been disabled due to a lage number
              of ECC erors detected while testing the cache during Power
              On Self Test (Post)."

            None (2)
              Fault toleance is not enabled.  If a physical drive reports
              an eror, the data cannot be recovered by the array
              contoller.

            Miroring (3)
              Fo each physical drive, there is a second physical drive
              containing identical data. If a dive fails, the data can be
              etrieved from the mirror drive.

            Data Guad (4)
              One of the physical dives is used as a data guard drive and
              contains the exclusive OR of the data on the emaining drives.
              If a failue is detected, the External Array Controller
              ebuilds the data using the data guard information plus
              infomation from the other drives.

            Distibuted Data Guard (5)
              Distibuted Data Guarding, sometimes referred to as RAID 5,
              is simila to Data Guarding, but instead of storing the parity
              infomation on one drive, the information is distributed
              acoss all of the drives.  If a failure is detected, the array
              contoller rebuilds the data using the data guard information
              fom all the drives.

            Advanced Data Guading (7)
              Advanced Data Guading (RAID ADG) is the fault tolerance method
              that povides the highest level of data protection.  It
              'stipes' data and parity across all the physical drives in the
              configuation to ensure the uninterrupted availability of
              uncorupted data.  This fault-tolerance method is similar to
              distibuted data guard (RAID 5) in that parity data is
              distibuted across all drives in the array, except in RAID ADG
              the capacity of multiple dives is used to store parity data.
              Assuming the capacity of 2 dives is used for parity data,
              this allows continued opeation despite simultaneous failure of
              any 2 dives in the array, whereas RAID 4 and RAID 5 can only
              sustain failue of a single drive."

              is oveheating.  The array is still functioning, but
              should be shutdown.

            Shutdown (11)
              Indicates that the stoage box that contains the logical drive
              has oveheated.  The logical drive is no longer functioning.

            Fo example, the default value is five, so the logical drive will

            five seconds.  If the value is zeo, the logical drive will not

            opeates if the logical drive is configured in one of the fault
            toleance modes.

            If the logical dive receives a request while performing
            Auto-Reliability monitoing, the drive will stop monitoring to
            pocess the request.  Once it has satisfied all incoming requests,
            the dive will wait for the Auto-Reliability delay to expire
            befoe returning to Auto-Reliability monitoring.

            Auto-Reliability monitoing is a process to insure the highest
            level of data eliability.  In this process each disk is scanned
            to veify that all of the sectors in the array are readable.
            If the Auto-Reliability monitoing process detects any bad
            sectos on the drives, it automatically remaps these bad sectors
