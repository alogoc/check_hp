Please update the 'lib' path at the top of check_hp_agents to fit your distribution.
check_hp_agents needs to locate the utils.pm library that comes with nagios-plugins.

Please do not misread the "-d" parameter, which stands for "DEBUG" and is not
intended for production use! check_hp_agents will output information about about
which object failed if there is any:

Compaq/HP Agent Check: cpqDaCntlrCondition (0:degraded) cpqDaLogDrvStatus (0.1:
recovering) cpqDaLogDrvCondition (0.1:degraded) cpqDaPhyDrvStatus (0.0:failed)
cpqDaPhyDrvCondition (0.0:failed)
