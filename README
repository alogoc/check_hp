REQUIREMENTS
============

Please update the 'lib' path at the top of check_hp_agents to fit your distribution.
check_hp_agents needs to locate the utils.pm library that comes with nagios-plugins.

You will need the Net::SNMP package as well. In most distributions this is available
as a package named "libsnmp-perl" - so make sure to install it if you stumble accross
an error starting with "Can't locate Net/SNMP.pm in @INC [...]".

OUTPUT
======

Please do not misread the "-d" parameter, which stands for "DEBUG" and is not
intended for production use! check_hp_agents will output information about about
which object failed if there is any:

recovering) cpqDaLogDrvCondition (0.1:degraded) cpqDaPhyDrvStatus (0.0:failed)
